## MSP DATASET

### 1. Introduction

We filtered and reconstructed four existing snowfall lidar datasets and labeled the snow points in each point cloud frame to form a mixed snow PC dataset (MSP dataset).

The overall parameters of the datasets are shown in the table below.

 The links to each of the four datasets are:

​	**Boreas**[1]:         https://www.boreas.utias.utoronto.ca/

​	**CADC**[2]:            http://cadcd.uwaterloo.ca/

​	**RADIATE**[3]:      https://pro.hw.ac.uk/radiate/

​	**WADS**[4]:           https://bitbucket.org/autonomymtu/wads/src/master

Note that the WADS dataset itself contains the labeling of snowfall points, for which we have only filtered the data and converted the format.

### 3. Obtaining method
The new dataset seems to exceed the limitations of github and we are looking for new data storage solutions. Until we provide a new way to access the data, please request it via email(chenghao.sun@foxmail.com).
